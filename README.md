Switch Off load &amp; Measure Capacity of batteries

![Picture](somca_02.JPG)

This picture shows (from left to right) my assistant Billy, a voltmeter showing battery voltage, SOMCA the device that switches off the load when voltage drops below a threshold adjustable with the BCD switches on the right of the frontplate. The battery on the right in front is connected to the input, a power resistor load is lying on the floor and is not visible here.

SOMCA has the following purposes:

1. switch off the load when voltage drops under the trhreshold, to prevent battery damage
2. measure voltage and current over time
3. from these calculate charge in As and Ah, and energy in Wh
4. store these values for later analysis
